                    lifelong fascination with tales of the unusual, the imaginary, and the grotesque, a tendency he has
                    had since he was a young boy. This spurned from his nightmares of Coppelius, whom he believes is the
                    Sandman, a fictional villain who throws and into the eyes of children until they fall out. He is
                    prone to fears and fantasies taking over his thoughts until
                    he can no longer tell what is real. His interest and obsession with coppelius soon yields to darker,
                    more cynical thought and eventually, insanity.</td>

                    offering reasonable explanations for them. She tries to appeal to Nathaniel’s better nature and
                    despairs when he shows the dark side of his personality. Clara represents the conflict between the
                    Enlightenment era's rational thinking, combined with the Romantic value of emotion and imagination.

                    in appearance, with exaggerated features, but even more monstrous in the way he frightens
                    or disgusts the protaganists. Coppelius shows up at key moments in the story, taunting and
                    terrifying
                    Nathaniel, and
                    making many cryptic references to eyes. Nathaniel is terrified of him, and finds Coppelius
                    responsible for the death of his father.</td>
