            <h3>Our Book:</h3>
            <p>Our book is the Sandman by E.T. Hoffman</p>
            <p>"The Sandman" is a psychological horror story that explores themes of fear, reality versus fantasy,
                and
                the impact of childhood trauma through the experiences of Nathanael, who becomes obsessed with the
                figure of the Sandman.</p>

            <h3>Historical Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hoffmann lived during the height</strong> of German Romanticism, and his personal clashes
                    with Prussian
                    authority shaped the dark, rebellious, and anti-rational tone of The Sandman.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Rapid technological change</strong> created fears of dehumanization, and Romantic thinkers
                    worried machines
                    would replace human emotion, individuality, and relationships—reflected in Hoffmann’s portrayal of
                    automatons as unsettling and threatening.</li>

                <li><strong>Psychology and psychoanalysis</strong> drew heavily from Hoffmann, with Freud using The
                    Sandman to explain
                    “the uncanny” and later psychiatrists interpreting his characters as early depictions of
                    schizophrenia or “splitting insanity.”</li>

            <h4>How do writers question the cost of progress or industrial and scientific advancement
                to the human
                spirit?</h4>
            <p> ETA Hoffman shows how the obsession with technology and it's progress can overpower the prioritization
                of the character's relationships.</p>
