            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                E.T.A. Hoffmann was a promising poet, a jurist, and musician born during the German Romantic Era. Many
                of his tales feature main characters who are demented, either permanently or temporarily, under the
                impact of events that their minds cannot handle. This is strongly derived from the dark times that
                Europe was going through, which had just followed many wars. His stories often showcase the way everyday
                life and fantasy coexisted and often merged, becoming one.
            </p>
            <p>
                His childhood was unstable, as his parents were divorced, with one being an alcoholic, and the other
                being often described as a hysterical and obsessively orderly woman, influencing the way he was raised
                and shaping his writing style to be similarly maniacal. Starting from his early teenage years, Hoffmann
                began painting and creating art compositions, and when he worked in the Prussian provinces, many said he
                began to become dissolute (E. T. A. Hoffmann).

            <h3>The Effect of His Life on His Work</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout his life, he suffered from the misery and constraints of Prussian reality, which he portrayed
                in his novels. He believed that only artists and children could escape the constraints of everyday life
                thanks to their imagination and befriended them at every opportunity, spontaneously come up with stories
                and fairy tales for them that were never written down.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of his childhood, the many jobs he had to carry at once, and the ever changing climate of
                Europe, "the constant doubling in Hoffmann’s writing has a specific correlate in his own biography"
                (Sheehy). The Sandman was written to be inspired by Hoffmann’s own childhood irrational fears of
                authoritarian figures, as well as his time as a jurist observing criminal trials.
