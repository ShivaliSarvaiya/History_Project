            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>E.T.A. Hoffman was a promising poet, a jurist, and musician born during the German Romantic Era. His
                childhood was instable, as his parents were divorced, with one being an alcoholic, and the other being
                often described as a hysterical and obsessively orderly woman, influencing the way he was raised and
                shaping his writing style. Starting from his early teenage years, Hoffman began painting and creating
                art compositions, and when he worked in the Prussian provinces, many said he began to become dissolute.

            <h3>The Effect of his Life on his Work</h3>
            <p>Many of his tales feature main characters who are demented, either permanently or temporarily, under the
                impact of events that their minds cannot handle. His stories often showcase the way everyday life and
                fantasy coexisted and often merged, becoming one. Throughout his life, he suffered from the misery and
                constraints of Prussian reality, which he portrayed in his novels. He believed that only artists and
                children could escape the constraints of everyday life thanks to their imagination and befriended them
                at every opportunity, spontaneously come up with stories and fairy tales for them that were never
                written down. Eventually, he was exiled and became isolated from society, where he began drawing,
                composing, and writing in his diary. </p>
