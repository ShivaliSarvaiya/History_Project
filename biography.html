            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                E.T.A. Hoffmann was a promising poet, jurist, and musician born during the German Romantic Era.
                His childhood was unstable: his parents divorced, his father struggled with alcoholism, and his mother
                was known for her strict, obsessive orderliness. These conditions shaped Hoffmann’s creative
                temperament and the tone of his later writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a young age, he immersed himself in painting, composition, and storytelling. During his work in the
                Prussian provinces, those around him noted that he began drifting into a more bohemian and dissolute
                lifestyle, deepening the imaginative complexity of his later tales.
            </p>

        <!-- Biography Section 2 -->
        <div class="grid-item support-2">
            <h3>The Effect of His Life on His Work</h3>
            <p>
                Hoffmann’s stories often depict individuals overwhelmed by forces beyond their control—psychological or
                supernatural. He explored the thin boundary between reality and fantasy, showing how the two worlds
                collide and merge.
            </p>
            <p>
                His personal dissatisfaction with Prussian life, along with his artistic sensibilities, fueled stories
                where imagination offered an escape from rigid social constraints. Children and artists, in his view,
                were uniquely able to perceive wonder in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Late in life, exile and isolation led him to produce deeply introspective works while he continued
                painting, composing, and writing in his diaries.
