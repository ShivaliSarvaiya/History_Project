                    <li>Romanticism reacted against Enlightenment ideas.</li>
                    <li>Technological change caused fear and distrust.</li>

            <h4>Romanticism vs Enlightenment</h4>
            <details class="card">
                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>The Sandman was written in 1815 during the peak of the German Romantic era, which stretched from 1800 - 1830. The Romantic era was a reaction against the Enlightenment's constant scientific thinking and rationalism. The enlightenment was a major turning point in history when ideas like rational thinking, natural rights, and human freedom were prominent. However, by the late 18th and 19th centuries many influential thinkers began questioning whether reason alone could guide societies. They "witnessed instead terror and revolution, corruption, gross commercial excess and the continued growth of violent colonialism" (Institute 23). These events led to rejection and the belief that scientific or technological progress would automatically improve human life. In retaliation, Romanticism focused on an appreciation of nature, the mysterious, and an idealization of the past. This transition from Enlightenment to Romanticism is showcased through the contrast and tension between Clara's rational explanations for the Sandman, combined with Nathaniel's inner torture and disparity.</p>

            <h4>Fear of Technology</h4>
            <details class="card">
                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>Also during this time, the introduction of technological and scientific advancements caused widespread disdain and fear from Romantic thinkers. This stemmed from several reasons, such as the spread of highly capable technology, which cause "widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment" and overall displeasure (Mokyr 15). This substitution caused fear of dehumanization through work, where individuality and creativity would be replaced by efficiency. Moreover, people feared that this mechanical-centered life would cut off emotional relationships and lead to a loss of autonomy, alienating closeness with others to prioritize uniformity. This ideology likely influenced Hoffmann's thinking as well, as he paints automations and new technologies as the antagonist in The Sandman.</p>

                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>This era saw Romantic writers reacting against Enlightenment's analyses, emphasizing emotion over reason, the uncanny, and inner experience (Silva). One article describes E.T.A. Hoffmann as being a main contributor to the Romantic interests in the weird and horrible (Britannica).</p>

            <h4>Influence on Literature</h4>
            <details class="card">
                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>E. T. A. Hoffmann, described as “the godfather of modern horror, weird fiction, and fantasy,” had an “inestimable influence” on writers like Poe, Dickens, Hawthorne, de Maupassant, Stevenson, and James and works such as Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Dracula, and The Turn of the Screw. The rise of popularity of the Sandman caused writers in the dark Romantic period explored the theme of schizophrenia as splitting insanity, inspired by Hoffman's recurring motif of protagonists whose failing grip on reality leads to madness or death shaped how later writers used the uncanny to explore the night side of modernity. This theme was especially popular during this time period because it bends the boundary between logic and madness, exploring the border between ideas of Romanticism and Enlightenment, represented by Nathaniel and Clara.</p>

            <h4>Influence on Psychology</h4>
            <details class="card">
                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>The Sandman also influenced early psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, who read his tales as windows into the mind. In 1919, Sigmund Freud’s used the sandman to illustrate ideas in his essay The Uncanny. Otto Rank, Freud’s student, treated Hoffmann’s figures as mentally ill and concluded that Hoffmann had “undoubtedly strong personal drives” behind such portrayals. Psychiatrist Panizza went a step further by adopting Hoffmann’s narrative technique itself, reworking his themes and motifs with up-to-date medical knowledge, and in Der Korsetten-Fritz he effectively continues The Sandman, shifting from romantic psychiatry’s view of insanity as a “clouding of perception with a confusion of ideas” to the modern notion of schizophrenia as a “splitting insanity.” This demonstrates how the Sandman gave later Dark Romantic intellectuals a model for psychological and symbolic Gothic fiction.</p>
