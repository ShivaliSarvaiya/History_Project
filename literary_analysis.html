            <h4>Withdrawal From Family</h4>

                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>In The Sandman, ETA Hoffman shows how the obsession with technology and it's progress can overpower
                    the prioritization of relationship. When Nathaniel's father becomes consumed by his late-night
                    Chemistry work with Coppelius, he completely withdraws from his family, so much so that Nathaniel
                    asks his mother, "Eh, mamma, who is this naughty Sandman, who always drives us away from papa? What
                    does he look like? (Hoffman 87)" The father's participation in scientific experiments "drives" him
                    away from his family, and instead of gathering with him, the children are sent away and learn to
                    associate their father's work with danger.

                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>A year after Coppelius stopped coming to the house, Nathaniel recalls that his "father was very
                    cheerful." However, "when as the clock struck nine, we heard the house-door creak… ‘That is
                    Coppelius,’ said my mother, turning pale… The tears started from my mother’s eyes. ‘But
                    father—father!’ she cried, ‘must it be so?’ ‘He comes to me for the last time… go with the
                    children—go—go to bed.’ (Hoffman 93)” Although his wife was clearly unhappy, and his children had to
                    leave and hide from his partner, Nathaniel's father chose to further his research. The father's
                    scientific pursuits showing how he prioritized Coppelius and scientific advancements over comfort,
                    safety, and the overall relationship with his family.</p>

                <p>Olympia represents and idealized, yet unreal partner that sets standards so high that it simply is
                    not achievable. Nathaniel wants to attain this perfection, when in reality he should be focusing on

                <p>Olympia is docile, agreeable, and beautiful, but she is a robot and has no true feelings for herself.
                    Nathaniel becomes obsessed with her and neglects all other aspects of his life. "Clara's image had
                    been wiped clean from his mind" (Hoffmann 112) and "his mother, Lothario, all had vanished from
                    memory" (Hoffmann 117).

                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>He prefers the “predictability” and “passiveness” of Olympia over the real, flawed human
                    relationships (like with Clara). Nathaniel became so obsessed with Olympia that he neglected to
                    foster his true relationships, abandoning his letter to Clara and shutting off his family from
                    memory. Through this example, Hoffmann critiques the way technology can distance us from authentic
                    social bonds.

            <h4>Influence on Literature</h4>
            <details class="card">
                <summary>Read more</summary>
                <p>E. T. A. Hoffmann, described as “the godfather of modern horror, weird fiction, and fantasy,” had an
                    “inestimable influence” on writers like Poe, Dickens, Hawthorne, de Maupassant, Stevenson, and James
                    and works such as Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Dracula, and The Turn of the Screw. The rise
                    of popularity of the Sandman caused writers in the dark Romantic period explored the theme of
                    schizophrenia as splitting insanity, inspired by Hoffman's recurring motif of protagonists whose
                    failing grip on reality leads to madness or death shaped how later writers used the uncanny to
                    explore the night side of modernity. This theme was especially popular during this time period
                    because it bends the boundary between logic and madness, exploring the border between ideas of
                    Romanticism and Enlightenment, represented by Nathaniel and Clara.</p>
