                <p>In The Sandman, ETA Hoffman shows how the obsession with technology and it's progress can overpower the prioritization of relationship. When Nathaniel's father becomes consumed by his late-night Chemistry work with Coppelius, he completely withdraws from his family, so much so that Nathaniel asks his mother, "Eh, mamma, who is this naughty Sandman, who always drives us away from papa? What does he look like? (Hoffman 87)" The father's participation in scientific experiments "drives" him away from his family, and instead of gathering with him, the children are sent away and learn to associate their father's work with danger.

            <h4>Fear of Technology</h4>

                <p>Also during this time, the introduction of technological and scientific advancements caused widespread disdain and fear from Romantic thinkers. This stemmed from several reasons, such as the spread of highly capable technology, which cause "widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment" and overall displeasure (Mokyr 15). This substitution caused fear of dehumanization through work, where individuality and creativity would be replaced by efficiency. Moreover, people feared that this mechanical-centered life would cut off emotional relationships and lead to a loss of autonomy, alienating closeness with others to prioritize uniformity. This ideology likely influenced Hoffmann's thinking as well, as he paints automations and new technologies as the antagonist in The Sandman.</p>

                <p>E. T. A. Hoffmann, described as “the godfather of modern horror, weird fiction, and fantasy,” had an “inestimable influence” on writers like Poe, Dickens, Hawthorne, de Maupassant, Stevenson, and James and works such as Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Dracula, and The Turn of the Screw. The rise of popularity of the Sandman caused writers in the dark Romantic period explored the theme of schizophrenia as splitting insanity, inspired by Hoffman's recurring motif of protagonists whose failing grip on reality leads to madness or death shaped how later writers used the uncanny to explore the night side of modernity. This theme was especially popular during this time period because it bends the boundary between logic and madness, exploring the border between ideas of Romanticism and Enlightenment, represented by Nathaniel and Clara.</p>

                <p>The Sandman also influenced early psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, who read his tales as windows into the mind. In 1919, Sigmund Freud’s used the sandman to illustrate ideas in his essay The Uncanny. Otto Rank, Freud’s student, treated Hoffmann’s figures as mentally ill and concluded that Hoffmann had “undoubtedly strong personal drives” behind such portrayals. Psychiatrist Panizza went a step further by adopting Hoffmann’s narrative technique itself, reworking his themes and motifs with up-to-date medical knowledge, and in Der Korsetten-Fritz he effectively continues The Sandman, shifting from romantic psychiatry’s view of insanity as a “clouding of perception with a confusion of ideas” to the modern notion of schizophrenia as a “splitting insanity.” This demonstrates how the Sandman gave later Dark Romantic intellectuals a model for psychological and symbolic Gothic fiction.</p>
